# projet-s2-19-2co
The goal of this project is an industrial version of Takenoko.
To this end, we do _continuous integration_, on the one hand, and develop a "client-server" version, on the other hand.

## 1. Continuous integration
In order to do continuous integration, we first increase the number of tests, in particular by increasing the number of the test types:
- unit tests,
- Cucumber tests,
- ...

We then improve our development practices: by applying a method of TDD (Test-Driven Development), or BDD (Behavior-Driven Development), on the one hand, and using Travis CI, on the other hand, in particular for continuous integration.

## 2. Client-server
In order to develop a "client-server" version, we start doing a study of architecture on the division in RESTful services between player(s) and game execution engine.
